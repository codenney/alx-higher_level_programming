Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 6-rectangle.py)

    Private instance attribute: width:
        property def width(self): to retrieve it
        property setter def width(self, value): to set it:
            width must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message width must be an integer
            if width is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message width must be >= 0
    Private instance attribute: height:
        property def height(self): to retrieve it
        property setter def height(self, value): to set it:
            height must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message height must be an integer
            if height is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message height must be >= 0
    Public class attribute number_of_instances:
        Initialized to 0
        Incremented during each new instance instantiation
        Decremented during each instance deletion
    Public class attribute print_symbol:
        Initialized to #
        Used as symbol for string representation
        Can be any type
    Instantiation with optional width and height: def __init__(self, width=0, height=0):
    Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the rectangle area
    Public instance method: def perimeter(self): that returns the rectangle perimeter:
        if width or height is equal to 0, perimeter has to be equal to 0
    print() and str() should print the rectangle with the character(s) stored in print_symbol:
        if width or height is equal to 0, return an empty string
    repr() should return a string representation of the rectangle to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval()
    Print the message Bye rectangle... (... being 3 dots not ellipsis) when an instance of Rectangle is deleted
    You are not allowed to import any module
